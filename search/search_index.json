You can do this to check that that doesn't matter when you use tempfolder Call the functions at the bottom of the file and run this directly with python instead of some unit test framework (like pytest \u2764\ufe0f): from pathlib import Path from tempfolder import use_temp_folder def add_config_file_to_folder ( folder : str ): with open ( f ' { folder } /config.cfg' , 'w' ) as f : f . write ( 'I_love=tempfolder' ) @use_temp_folder ( 'some_folder' ) def test_add_config_file_to_folder (): add_config_file_to_folder ( 'some_folder' ) assert Path ( 'some_folder' ) . exists () assert Path ( 'some_folder/config.cfg' ) . exists () def test_look_for_the_folder_and_the_file (): assert not Path ( 'some_folder' ) . exists () assert not Path ( 'some_folder/config.cfg' ) . exists () test_add_config_file_to_folder () test_look_for_the_folder_and_the_file () No exception was raised right?
